## Etiquette

- **All PRs should be made to the `devel` branch, not `master`.**

- Come check-in in the [Vulcan Slack channel](http://slack.telescopeapp.org/). 👋

- Don't hesitate to issue PRs for any mistakes you find in the docs. 👩🏼‍💻

- When you contribute new feature or just changes to existing ones, please also update these docs. 📖

- Be nice 😉

## Branches

- `master` branch reflects the contents of [Vulcan Docs](https://docs.vulcanjs.org/) and the documentation matches the latest version of the Vulcan packages published on Atmosphere
- `devel` branch is the bleeding edge, documenting the `devel` branch of the Vulcan codebase
